    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      I start my developing journey when i attended to college. 
      my first programming language was Python and it was great.
      then i learned CPP and C and find them out they are the most powerful programming languages.
      and for practicing programming, i start to develop an ACM online judge system written in python and 
      django framework. by the time, i learned web-servers and REST APIs and Linux for deployment.

      After college i was pushed to financial systems. it is very a good experience for me
      and i will continue the rest of my career in this field.

      Learning was a part of me and always will be. 
      i like to learn, try and apply new technologies to my work. <br>
      Performability is my main concern in development process. 
      and i hope one day i'll become profesional software architect.
