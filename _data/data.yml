career-profile:
    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      I start my developing journey when i attended to college. 
      Python is my primary programming language and it always will be.
      After Python, CPP and C are my secondary languages which i use to gain more performance. <br>
      Linux is my programming environment.

      After college i was put in financial systems. It was very a good experience for me
      and i will spend the rest of my career in this field.

      Learning was a part of me and always will be.
      I like to learn, try and apply new technologies to my work.
      Working as a team and Scrum methodology play an important role in my development process. <br>

      Performability is my main concern in development process.
      Working hard to be a professional software architect. 

      I find myself a person who wants to understand every little things behind anything (Software and Hardware). <br>
      It helps me to understand better and use it in future projects. <br>
      I am thirsty for knowledge and never giving up on learning things.
